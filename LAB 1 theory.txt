======================
What are the agenda?
---------------
	Cloud ?

	Cloud Computing ?

	Before cloud , how we work?

	After cloud, what is market changes?

	Features of Cloud Computing?

	What are the requirement of cloud based infra?

	Why we deploy openstack in any organization?



======================


Cloud ?
	Physical resource that cannot see
	Cloud is Datacentere
	CPU RAM HD N/W
	


	
Cloud Computing ?
	Its a model
	IAAS, SAAD, PAAS
	public private hybrid
	a service in IT infra
	
	a model that to be implemented as app, os, libraries, runtime
	
	SCALABLE


Before cloud , how we work?
	bare matel virtuizations
	2010 nasa and rackspace found Openstack
	resource tightly coupled
	resource overprovison/ underprovisoon
	one app bind one singe H/W resource

	Office ==> Project ==> admin ==> machine
		hardware configuration
		OS
		application
		vendor
		liscinecing cost		
		deploy
		testing
		handover
				take more time for planning




After cloud, what is market changes?
	on demand resouce allocation
	current 8GB(RAM)  ===> 4 sec (UP ==> 16GB (UP)

	busineess need
		agile, cost optimization
		effeciency, microservice
		HW independent
		pay as u go
	better resorce consumption
	market spike learn.

	EX on company
		Infra > Service > Hardware > OS > Service > Planning > testing
		
		Now this modes make faster workflow in comapany
		or in industry
		
		better solution and better planning, fast product delivery

	fast > SCALE IN and SCALE OUT
		
		



Features of Cloud Computing?





What are the requirement of cloud based infra?

Why we deploy openstack in any organization?





======================
The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing

https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf

https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/GOVPUB-C13-74cdc274b1109a7e1ead7185dfec2ada#:~:text=Cloud%20computing%20is%20a%20model,effort%20or%20service%20provider%20interaction.



Essential Characteristics:
-----------------------------
	On-demand self-service
	Resource pooling
	Rapid elasticity
	Measured service
	Scalabiity




	Shared Pool
		Single HW fells and used by single user, 
		but actually shared by multiple user.




	Single-tanency
		Single HW for sigle user or single project or single company.



	Multitanency
		Single HW for multiple user or multiple project or multiple company.
		No backend dependency
		
		backend layer/ user or client layer	


		example
			20 floor house >> 1 floor / 2 floor ../5 floor
			selling as rent >> tenent
			
			bill (quota) of > electricity > water
			reffered as QUOTA LIMIT 








Proof of concept ==> check google

======================

Scnerio 

	XYZ datacenter >> hardware own >> admin own 
		planning team own >> life cycle team own 
		R n D team own > vendor other
				[OS vendor + service vendor ]
	



	redhat OS + oenstack + nagios + inhouse service
